# Demonstration Notebooks

This notebooks were designed in order to showcase the functions and the pipeline that was created in order to preprocess images, experiment, evaluate, and store results of the project.

# Contents 

- demo_notebook.ipynb: I suggest you to check out this one first. It focusses on the image processing pipeline, it explains the functions and showcases the process that an image goes through before being passed to a certain model.
- experimentation.ipynb: It focusses on the evaluation pipeline that I designed in order to compile the experiments performed over several models and datasets.
